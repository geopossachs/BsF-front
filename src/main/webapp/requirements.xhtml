<h2>Requirements</h2>
<br />
<b:well>
	<b>BootsFaces is targeted at Java EE 6/7 and requires a Java 1.7 or later VM. The version hosted at Maven Central
		requires at least Java 8. Versions for Java 7, 9, 10, and 11 are available <a target="#" href="https://github.com/TheCoder4eu/BootsFaces-OSP/releases">at
			the project site</a>.
	</b>
	<br /><br />
	<b>JSF 2.2 and JSF 2.3 are supported.</b>
	<br /><br />
	<b>BootsFaces supports Oracle Mojarra 2.3+ and Apache MyFaces 2.3+</b>
	<br /><br />
	<p>
		<b:badge value="Attention" />
		<h:outputText value="&#160;" />Some notes: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Note1</b>: Oracle has dropped Commercial support for Glassfish as of version 4.0. Glassfish will therefore be
			only the Reference Implementation for Java EE.<br />
			BootsFaces is therefore first tested for compliance in Glassfish, then tested on other Application Servers such as
			WildFly/JBoss and TomEE.<br />
			We are also going to test BootsFaces with Payara, which inherited the Glassfish codebase.
			<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Note2</b>: Glassfish 3.2 is installed with an old version of the JSF library(2.1.6) with a known bug fixed in
			version 2.1.8. we suggest you to update the library to the latest version.
		</li>
	</ul>
